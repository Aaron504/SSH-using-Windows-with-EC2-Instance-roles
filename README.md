# AWS EC2 Instance Access using SSH and Instance Roles on Windows


 

<h2>SSH for Secure Access</h2>
Imagine having a special key that lets you open the door to your cloud computer securely. SSH (Secure Shell) is like that special key for your virtual cloud computer. Even though I'm using a Windows computer, I've mastered the art of using SSH to connect to my EC2 instances on AWS. This allows me to access my cloud computers from anywhere in the world, just like I'm sitting right in front of them.
